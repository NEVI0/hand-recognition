### :wave: Hand Recognition with Python

I decided to create this project to learn much more about **Python**. But, instead of just detect the hand, I decided to add three modes in it.

- **Count fingers mode**;
- **Volume controller mode**;
- **Object moving mode**.

Which one with differences use cases but with the same logic!

### :hammer_and_wrench: Running the project

- First, make sure that you have **Python** installed on your computer. Use this [link](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download and install it;
- Then, download and install [PyCharm IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pt-br/pycharm/download/#section=windows) to access the project code, refactor it and even better, create your own features; 
- Now, you need to clone this repository in a directory of your computer. To clone it use the following command: `https://github.com/NEVI0/hand-recognition.git`;
- With the project in hands, open it in **PyCharm** and install the required packages to use it. After that, just run pressing `Shift + F10` the `main.py`.

### :package: List of required packages

- **Python-opencv:** `pip install opencv-python`;
- **Mediapipe:** `pip install mediapipe`;
- **Pycaw**: `pip install pycaw`;
- **Keyboard**: `pip install keyboard`;

#### :warning: Note

Maybe the version of the packages cause some errors in the process of running it.
